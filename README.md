# Machine learning test
Testing machine learning on remote camera traps


Testing Tabak *et al* Nth America deep learning model on desert camera trap data.
Model trained on Nth American species and as is from paper.
Testing to see if it can pick up animals, vehicles, people and empty photos in general.
